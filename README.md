# Transverse Ising Model

Monte Carlo simulation of the quantum transverse Ising model 

## Description
We use a Monte Carlo method to calculate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional quantum transverse Ising model. The magnetization, the susceptibility and the reduced fourth-order cumulant are estimated.

### Installing

* Install gfortran compiler or another compiler

### Executing program

* Gfortran: gfortran -o (executablename) (file.f90)
* Check the readisingt.in and change the parameters according to your need and the description in the end of "in" file. 
* If you run in the TORQUE environment, use the Job_MC.sh making the approprieted changes.
* Run: ./executablename
